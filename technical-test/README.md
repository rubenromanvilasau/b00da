# Buda Tests

In this folder there are two more folders with tests required through email, I did both of them, first one is the API that was built with Node js, Express, Axios, Dotenv and Jest for tests.
The second folder called 'dca-buda' contains a NextJs app for test 2.

I wanted to give both tests separated logic and take advantage of NextJs functionality to only get focused in  "front" development in dca-buda app.

For the second test I created a wireframe in figma to give design some shape.
