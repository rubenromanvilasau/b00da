# Buda Tests

In this folder there are two more folders with tests required through email, first one is the API that was built with Node js, Express, Axios, Dotenv and Jest for tests.
The second folder called 'dca-buda' contains a NextJs app for test 2.

Could I've done it both in the same NextJs app? Sure. I just didn't because I wanted to give both tests separated logic and take advantage of NextJs functionality to only get focused in  "front" development.

For the second test I created a wireframe in figma to give design some shape.
