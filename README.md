# Buda process

## Info
All required tests are in this repository,
Explanation of 3 main folders:
- PoW: contains an script to generate the hash that contains b00da word
- Google-forms-test: refers to the 2nd challenge of Black Buda event
- technical-test: Refers to API and DCA app tests, I did both tests, so there's a folder for each test.

In technical-test each folder has it's README file
