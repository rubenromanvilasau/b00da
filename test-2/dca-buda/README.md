## Getting Started

App was created using Node v21.6.0, there's a .nvmrc in root, so you can do nvm use if you got v21.6.0 installed.

nvm use
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

There are also docker files to create image and run it,
so just do 
```bash
docker-compose build
docker compose up
``` 
App will run on production mode.
